# How-well-do-you-know-nodeJS

## Description
A list of specific questions by Samer Buna a Node.js developer is expected to answer

### 1. How come when you declare a global variable in any Node.js file itâ€™s not really global to all modules?
A module's code is wrapped by a function wrapper that looks like the following
```
(function(exports, require, module, __filename, __dirname){
    // module code
})
```
This wrapping allows to keeps top-level variables (defined with var, const or let) scoped to the module, rather than to the global object.
In node, the top-level scope is not the golbal scope; `var something` inside a Node module will be **local to that module**.

### 2. When exporting the API of a Node module, why can we sometimes use `exports` and other times we have to use `module.exports`?
To understand the difference, we can look at this simplified view of a JavaScripe file in Node.js:
```
var module = { exports: {} };
var exports = module.exports;

// your code

return module.exports;
```

so, `exports` is initially an alias to `module.exports`. If you want to simply export an object with named fields, you can use the `exports` shortcut. For example, had we written `exports.a = 9`, we'd actually export this object: `{a: 9}`.

However, if you want to export a function or another object, you have to use the `module.exports` object. For example: `module.exports = function bar(){}`. Once you do that, `exports` and `module.exports` no longer reference the same object.

### 3. Can we require local files without using relative paths?
There are several options, but my favourites are these:

###### 1. The Alias
1. Install the [module-alias](https://www.npmjs.com/package/module-alias) package
```
npm i --save module-alias
```
2. Add paths to your `package.json` like this:
```
{
    "_moduleAliases": {
        "@lib": "app/lib",
        "@models": "app/models"
    }
}
```
3. In your entry-point file, before any `require()` calls:
```
require('module-alias/register')
```
4. You can now require files like this:
```
const Article = require('@models/article');
```

###### 2. The Global
1. In your entry-point file, before any `require()` calls:
```
global.__base = __dirname + '/';
```
2. In your very/far/away/module.js
```
const Article = require(`${__base}app/models/article`);
```

###### 3. The Module
1. Install some module:
```
npm install app-module-path --save
```
2. In your entry-point file, before any `require()` calls:
```
require('app-module-path').addPath(`${__dirname}/app`);
```
3. In your very/far/away/module.js
```
const Article = require('models/article');
```

### 4. What is the Event Loop? Is it part of V8?
In event-driven programming, an application expresses interest in certain events and respond to them when they occur. This is the way Node.js can handle asynchronous execution while running the code in a single thread. When an asynchronous operation starts (for example, when we call `setTimeout`, `http.get` or `fs.readFile`), Node.js sends these operations to a different thread allowing V8 to keep executing our code. Node also calls the callback when the counter has run down or the IO/http operation has finished. In Node.js, the responsibility of gathering events from the operating system or monitoring other sources of events is handled by [libuv](https://github.com/libuv/libuv), and the user can register callbacks to be invoked when an event occurs. The event-loop usually keeps running forever.
